  <h1>Adding cards</h1>
  <p>
    There are three ways to add an identity card:
    <ul>
      <li>got to <span class="menu">Edit &gt; <img src="../images/add_card.png"> Add Card...</span>;</li>
      <li>or click <span class="button"><img src="../images/add_card_32.png"> Add Card...</span> in the tool bar;</li>
      <li>or press <span class="key-stroke">Ctrl+A</span></li>
    </ul>
    You should be seeing a form dialog named “Add Card”. This is where you have to enter information
    about the person. You can leave a field empty if you don't have the information. Birth and Death
    fields can be incomplete. You can also select an image.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you are finished, click <span class="button">Validate</span> to create the card. If you
    clicked before finishing, don't worry you can come back and edit it later.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, there should be a card at the top left corner of the Workbench. You can move it where you
    want it to be.
