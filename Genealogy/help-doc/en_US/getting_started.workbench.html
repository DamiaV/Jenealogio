  <h1>The Workbench</h1>
  <p>
    When the Workbench is launched, the first thing you see is a blank space. This is where you will
    edit your family tree after you have created a project. You can create a new tree by selecting
    <span class="menu">File &gt; <img src="../images/new_tree.png"> New Tree...</span> or by clicking
    <span class="button"><img src="../images/new_tree_32.png">New Tree</span> button in the tool bar.
    You will be prompted to enter a name for the tree. Once you've done that, click
    <span class="button">Validate</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the project is created, you should be seeing that some buttons are now enabled. We can
    start working from now on.
