  <h1>Deleting cards</h1>
  <p>
    First, select the card you want to delete.<br>
    Once again, there are three ways:
    <ul>
      <li>go to <span class="menu">Edit &gt; <img src="../images/delete_card.png"> Delete Card</span>;</li>
      <li>or click <span class="button"><img src="../images/delete_card_32.png"> Delete Card</span>;</li>
      <li>or press <span class="key-stroke">Delete</span></li>
    </ul>
    You should be asked to confirm the action. Click <span class="button">Yes</span>. The card
    should be removed from the Workbench.<br>
    If the card was linked to another, the link is also deleted.<br>
    <b>N.B: once a card is removed, it is lost forever and cannot be retreived.</b>
