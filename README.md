# Jenealogio

Jenealogio is a simple and easy-to-use family tree editor/viewer.

Currently available languages:

I don't plan to add any more but feel free to send me language files for the language of your choice (I won't be responsible for any translation mistakes).
Any typo corrections are also welcome.

You can read the help doc over [here](http://darmo-creations.net/products/jenealogio/help-doc/) (available in English, French and Esperanto).

If you want to see what's coming or what I'm working on, visit my Trello [here](https://trello.com/b/bL5gDhpJ/jenealogio).
