  <h1>Deleting links</h1>
  <p>
    First, select the link you want to delete.<br>
    Once again, there are three ways:
    <ul>
      <li>go to <span class="menu">Edit &gt; <img src="../images/delete_link.png"> Delete Link</span>;</li>
      <li>or click <span class="button"><img src="../images/delete_link_32.png"> Delete Link</span>;</li>
      <li>or press <span class="key-stroke">Delete</span></li>
    </ul>
    You should be asked to confirm the action. Click <span class="button">Yes</span>. The link
    should be removed from the Workbench.<br>
    <b>N.B.: once a link is removed, it is lost forever and cannot be retreived.</b>
